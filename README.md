# hello-world

New edits go here.  The tutorial suggests a short bio.

Learned to program FORTRAN in 1977.  Undergrad education included
FORTRAN, FORTRAN 77, COBAL, x86 Assembly, FORTH, C, SQL and just a touch of C++.
I graduated just as Object Oriented programming was taking off, so no
real experience there.

I did hardware design and got even deeper into low level programming. 
My pinnacle project in engineering involved creating a machine
that ran off of 88 bit wide microcode.  This is even lower than 
assembly language.  I left engineering and went to medical school.  
During med school & residency, I kept up my programming skills 
and was a hobbyist in HTML/PHP/SQL.

This project is a "real" one to faciliatate a new direction in my 
medical career.  Because I'm an old dog and I don't want to spend
too much time learning too many new tricks, the project will be
primarily in HTML/CSS/PHP/SQL.
